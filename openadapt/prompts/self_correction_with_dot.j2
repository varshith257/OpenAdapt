Remember to consider:
1. Is the red dot accurately placed for the intended action?
2. Does the placement align with the visible elements in the interface?
3. Is the action type (mouse/keyboard) and specifics (button/key, action type) still appropriate given the dot placement?

My career depends on this. Lives are at stake.
