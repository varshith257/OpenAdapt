You are tasked with generating the next action event in a sequence. Please analyze the following information:

Current Window Information:
{{ current_window | pprint }}

Recorded Actions:
{% for action in recorded_actions %}
{{ action | pprint }}
{% endfor %}

Replayed Actions So Far:
{% for action in replayed_actions %}
{{ action | pprint }}
{% endfor %}

Replay Instructions:
{{ replay_instructions }}

Using the above information and the provided screenshot, generate the next action event by following these steps:
1. **Analyze the Current State**: Examine the current window information and the latest screenshot.
2. **Review Past Actions**: Consider both recorded and replayed actions to understand the sequence and context.
3. **Apply Replay Instructions**: Implement any modifications or instructions provided.
4. **Determine the Next Action**: Identify the appropriate coordinates (x, y) and action type needed to proceed.

Specify the x and y coordinates for where you would like a red dot to be painted, representing the target location for this action.

Provide your response in the JSON format specified in the system prompt. Be as precise as possible with your coordinates and action details.

My career depends on this. Lives are at stake.
